        <p class="blogdesc">I took an overnight train for the very first time in my life.

            Overnight trains including Sunrise are really time and cost efficient. Travel time is not wasted because it also serves as sleep time, and you don't have to pay for accomodation, and you can spend time from the morning at your destination.
            
            Sunrise Express would be the first option, since it's the only daily operated sleeper train in Japan. To my surprise, it has over 20 years of history and still the seats and facilities were so clean. (Facilities must have been renewed at some point.)
            
            During the trip, I found that the Sunrise is very well-loved by so many people. Even it is operated daily, all the seats are always fully reserved. There were solo travellers like myself, couples, families, workers and so on. A lot of people, not only the passengers, were taking photos of the special moment with Sunrise.
            
            As I was very satisfied with the experience, I've already been working on to make another reservation right after getting off of it.</p>
