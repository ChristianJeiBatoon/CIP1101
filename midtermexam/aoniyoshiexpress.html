        <p class="blogdesc">The Aoniyoshi is a refurbished Kintetsu 12200 series that were originally designed in the 1960s and 1970s. The train has four cars, and they have been renovated with purple exterior, with window-facing lounge seats, allowing you to enjoy the beautiful natural views of Japan.

            The walls and the carpet are also decorated with mandala-like patterns of birds and flowers called “Tenpyo”, which are also associated with Nara’s past as a capital city of Japan.
            
            In addition to its authentic design, the train is also equipped with free Wi-Fi connection, allowing you to stay mobile during the journey.</p>
